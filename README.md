# OctoPrint-WifiSdSupport

 OctoPrint plugin which adds support for Toshiba FlashAir Wifi SD cards. Each file which is uploaded to OctoPrint will be automatically cloned to the sd card using wifi.
 
 On many 3D-Printers (like the Anet A8 owned by myself), the uploading to sd card takes ages. If you want to print from sd card anyway, one simple and fast way is using a Wifi Sd card. 

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

Just set the IP address or hostname of the FlashAir Wifi SD card in OctoPrint frontend after installing the plugin.
